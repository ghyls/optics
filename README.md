# Optics simulations

Here are a few optics simulations. Currently,

AngElipsom.py: simulates the changes in the ellipsometric angles upon reflection, as a function of real and complex parts of the refractive index.

Laminafina.py: A simulation made with Bokeh which simulates the changes in the diffraction pattern, function of wavelength, the refractive index, and the thickness of the plate and reflectivity. It can be executed in any explorer, and it is currently uploaded on the blog associated with this repository.

Laminafinadatos: returns (in terminal) properties such as Contrast, coherence length, maximum interference order, spectral width and the angular position of any maximum, with their error. It's some kind of "behind the scenes" of 'laminafina.py'.
