# Optics simulations

Here are a few optics simulations. Currently,

AngElipsom.py: simulates the changes in elipsometric angles upon reflection, as function of real and complex parts of refractive index.

Laminafina.py: A simulation made with Bokeh witch simulates the changes in diffraction pattern, function of wavelength, refractive index, thickness of the plate and reflectivity. It can be executed in any explorer, and you can test it in the blog associated with this reprository.

Laminafinadatos: returns (in terminal) properties such as Contrast, coherence length, maximum interference order, sectral width and the angular position of some maximum, with their error. It's some kind of "behind the scenes" of 'laminafina.py'.

You can find a more detailed description in Poster.pdf or in
